# satellite-dodging
To address the problem of bright commercial satellite streaks in images from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, we create heuristics for satellite dodging strategies using the surveyâ€™s scheduling algorithm. We computationally forecast satellite trajectories to account for the growing satellite population during Rubin operations. Our results help maximize efficiency and quality of this flagship observatory.


Dependencies:
As usual, suggest using anaconda and creating a fresh environement for installing with something like: `conda create -n sat-env ; conda activate sat-env`

* rubin_sim: Maybe just `conda install -c conda-forge rubin_sim` Full instructions at:  https://github.com/lsst/rubin_sim
* shapely: `conda install -c conda-forge shapely`
* skyfield:  `pip install skyfield`

Files: 
Compare_sim_runs.ipynb contains all result plots, including evaluation of dodging efficiency, number of missed exposures, and trade-off between pixel loss and coadded depth. 
compare_methods.ipynb contains testing of the satellite streak length method and speed optimization testing
